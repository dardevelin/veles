/**
 * This widget is able to draw arrows pointing between rows.
 * As input (updateArrows) it takes row attach points and vector of Arrow
 * objects.
 * Attach points are pixel-level heights (increasing downwards)
 * where arrows will originate or terminate.
 *
 * Arrow objects contain three fields: start_row and end_row are logical
 * rows where arrow will start and end, i.e. arrow will start at height
 * row_attach_points[arrow.start_row] and terminate at
 * row_attach_points[arrow.end_row],
 * therefore start_row and end_row must be lower than size of row_attach_points.
 * Otherwise it will be skipped.
 *
 * Field level means how far from right edge the vertical part of the arrow will
 * be placed.
 * The higher max level, the denser the arrows are packed.
 * Distance between arrows in adjacent levels is calculated automagically
 * based on requested widget width and max level.
